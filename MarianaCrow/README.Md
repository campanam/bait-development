## Scripts  
[mariana_crow_drop_baits.rb](mariana_crow_drop_baits.rb) randomly selects quality-controlled 20,000 nuclear SNP baits for the final bait set. *NB: this script was adapted from a previous script that included mitochondrial baits. Since no mitochondrial baits were included in this dataset, this portion of the script is irrelevant.*  

## Baits  
The final bait set is available [here](mariana_crow_baits.fa).
